Kaishi is Japanese for Start, Beginning, or Commencement, and that is what this is, a start.

Kaishi is to be a simple template with which others can create style sheets that are both readable and usable.

Thusly, I am creating a basis in several formats such as SASS, LESS, and STYLUS, as well as in normal CSS, that way this template may be useful to anyone. It is my goal to write a template, not a full css grid or framework, in saying this, I mean that I will leave the actual styling to you, but will be writing up a few basic styles to showcase the intent of this template.
